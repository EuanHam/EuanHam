- My interests lie in computer graphics, fullstack development, and natural language processing
- I'm currently working on [Threeify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNPZ87aYXOs), a web record player visualized with Three.js
- I also have a portfolio at [here](https://euanham.github.io/euan/) if you're curious
